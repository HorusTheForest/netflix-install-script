# netflix-install-script

This is a small script that prepares an OSMC Kodi v.18 (Leia) (Kodi v.19 Matrix, with some editing of script before it runs) installation for the netflix addon. 
Automates the needed steps to get Netflix addon to work. It installs the needed python crypto handling modules, downloads the repository (by default the Kodi v.18 repository).

Haven't personally tried the Matrix version yet so I can't speak about it working there since it uses Python 3 and that isn't in OSMC by default.

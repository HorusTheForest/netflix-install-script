# netflix-install-script

This is a small script that prepares an OSMC Kodi v.18 and v.19 to install for the Netflix repository. 
Automates the needed steps to get Netflix addon to work. It installs the needed python crypto handling modules, downloads the repository.

Haven't personally tried it yet, but will within a few days.
